question 2 

This is an incident that happened a minute ago. A theif come to suja's house but suja is an iron lady chase after the theif and caught him red handend.
so the distance between suja and theif is 48 m. suja rans 4 m/s and theif ran 3 m/s. so you want to find at what distance does the thief caught?


solution 

let assume d is the distance travelled by the theif. or we can say additional distance travelled by suja inorder to catch the theif.

speed of suja 4 m/s 
speed of theif 3 m/s 
speed = distance / time

here this happens in same that is theif and suja ran at same time . 

this is the hint 


so time  for suja and theif same t1 = t2 

so do math 
(48 + d) / 4 = d / 3 

144 + 3d = 4d
 d = 144 m

 actually you can say this answer in less than a millisecond. because you are the theif ha haaa.... acually you know relative speed you can find it faster.
