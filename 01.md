question 1 

if a boy going daily to his school. one day he get motivated and reach his school 25 minutes early because he walk faster 11/5 times. so can you guess on what time 
did he reach school daily.


solution 



funny way 


we know speed = distance / time 
so assume the boy goes to school daily distance d. 
here the part is that the boy goes to school in the second case too. only his walking speed chages.
so assume s be the speed he walk daily to school.
on a particular day he gets motivated his speed lets assume s1.
time on both cases is different so assume t1 and t2.

so in case one 
s = d / t1;
in case 2 
s1 = d / t2;

lets do some magic here d is same so we can write d = s x t1   and also d = s1 x t2 

so s x t1 = s1 x t2 -- 1

then magic happens 

s1 = s x 11/5
t2 = (t1 - 25 minutes)

substitute this  in equation 1

s x  t1 = s x 11/5 (t1 - 25)

s common cancel 
and do basic math 

5t1 = 11t1 - 275 

- 6t1 = - 275
  t1 = 275/6
  
can you guess the answer ?
ha haa....
